### A. (30 points)

Using the Minesweeper AI Agent algorithm discussed in class, create and simplify and knowledge map for the game of Minesweeper for three different Minesweeper games. Pick a small board (say 4 x 4) with 6 to 10 unknown tiles. Label the tiles a, b, c … and create a knowledge map.

Simplify the knowledge map until no additional information (ie. mines and positions to open) can be found.

Add each of your sample knowledge maps (original to final simplified) to a single word processing document. Looking for either scanned hand-drawn work or neatly typed work.

**Note:** Output from program below will not be accepted.

For each of your three games show the following

1. Show the original game (screenshot or type)  
2. Starting knowledge map ie. {a,b,c} = 2  
3. Steps taken to simplify and find mines/open positions  
4. Final knowledge map

### B. (10 points)

Use the code in AI_Mines_Lehman.py to verify your work.  
Code one of your games using this file and upload the file AI_Mines_YourName.py Show the board in your comments.

---

### C. (20 points)

Using the logic class from Harvard’s CS 50 course (logic.py and testLogic.py) 
update the testLogic.py for a sample scenario. 
Describe the scenario in your comments and add your name and date.

You will upload your modified `testLogic.py`.

### As a single .zip file

1. `testLogic.py`  
2. Three knowledge maps (.pdf)  
3. `AI_Mines_YourName.py`

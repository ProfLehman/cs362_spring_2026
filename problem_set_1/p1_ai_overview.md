**Spring 2026**  
**Due: Thursday, January 22nd at class time**  
**60 points**  

# P1 - AI Overview

## Part 1. - AI in the news (6 points)

Find and read **two recent (within the past year) news articles** related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. You may use the article from the January 15 class. 

Write a **one paragraph (four or more sentences) summary** of the article and identify the AI or Machine Learning sub-area (or areas) that apply to the article.

Include a **web link** to the article.

## Part 2. - What is AI and Machine Learning? (24 points)

Write a one to two-page single-spaced overview paper answering the question "What is AI and Machine Learning"?  

In addition to Russel and Norvig, find three (or more) additional sources (website, book, papers/articles) to support your paper (a total of 4 or more). 
List these references using a standard format at the end of your paper and cite them within your paper.

>Russell, S. J., & Norvig, P. (2021). Artificial intelligence: A modern approach (4th ed.). Pearson.


As part of your overview, include the answers to the following:

- What was your definition of AI **before** starting this class? (assume it has changed a bit already)

- List and briefly describe the subfields of AI?  (ie. natural language processing, knowledge representation, etc...)

- List and briefly describe the fields that support AI (ie. computer science, mathematics, etc...)

- Read the Chapter 1 text from Russell and Norvig and briefly summarize their view of AI

- What is the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

## Part 3. - Turing Paper (30 points)

Read Alan Turing's 1950 paper titled ***"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"***, which introduces the concept of the Imitation Game, which later became known as the Turing Test.

Answer each of the following questions (3 to 4 sentences each). For each question, copy/paste a sentence (or so) from the paper that relates to the question, list the corresponding page number from the PDF, and write a short note on how the text supports or applies to your question.  For example, when answering question #1, you could include the following (and feel free to use this!).

>Reference (page 1 - Turing describes Imitation Game): "The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
'imitation game." 

**Bring a copy (paper or digital) for discussion on Thursday, January 22, in class**.

1. What are the key components and objectives of the Imitation Game, and how does it work?

2. Turing suggests that a computer can be considered intelligent if it can successfully mimic human responses in the game. Do you agree with this definition of intelligence? Why or why not? (Your thoughts, not AI) 

3. Describe a criticism, a limitation, or an objection to the Imitation Game as a measure of intelligence.

4. Turing raises the question of whether machines can think. What is one argument he presents regarding this question?

5. Describe one way the Imitation Game may have influenced the development of artificial intelligence and the field of natural language processing?

6. Turing's paper was written in 1950. How do you think advancements in technology and our understanding of AI have changed the way we perceive the Imitation Game today? (Your thoughts, not AI)

## Note on AI  use

You may use AI to help with your responses. 

You are asked to read the Russel and Norvig chapter 1 text and the Turing Paper.

Please give **your thoughts** for Part 3 - #2 and #6.

List any AI system (or systems) you used to assist with the homework and briefly (1-sentence) describe how you used the system.

# P1 AI Overview

## (Part 1.) AI in the news (6 points)

Find and read **two recent (within past year) news articles** related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. You may use the article from 1/15 class. 

Write a **one paragraph (four or more sentences) summary** of the article and identify the the AI or Machine Learning sub-area (or areas) that apply to the article.

Include a **web link** to the article.

## (Part 2._ What is AI and Machine Learning? (20 points)

Write a one to two page sincle spaced overview paper answering the question "What is AI and Machine Learning"?  

In addition to Russel and Norvig, find three (or more) sources to support your paper. 
List this references using a standard format at the end of your paper and cite them within your paper.


As part of your overview include the answers to the following:

- What was your definition of AI **before** starting this class? (assume it has changed a bit already)

- List and briefly describe the subfields of AI?  (ie. natural language processing, knowledge representation, etc...)

- List and briefly describe the fields that support AI (ie. computer science, mathematics, etc...)

- Read the Chapter #1 text from Russell and Norvig and summarize their view of AI

- What is the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

## Turing Paper (24 points)

Read Alan Turing's 1950 paper titled ***"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"*** which in introduces the concept of the Imitation Game, which later became known as the Turing Test.

Answer each of the following questions (3 to 4 sentences each). For each question copy/paste a sentence (or so) from the paper that relates to the question, list the corresponding page number from the PDF, and write a short note for how the text supports or applies to your question.  For example, when answering question #1 you could inlude the following (and feel free to use this!).

>Reference (page 1 - Turing describes Imitation Game): "The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
'imitation game." 

**Bring a copy (paper or digital) for discussion Wednesday 1/22 in class**.

Note: You may use AI to help with your responses, but am looking for your throughts, especially #6. If you use AI for assistance, list the AI system you used.

1. What are the key components and objectives of the Imitation Game, and how does it work?

2. Turing suggests that a computer can be considered intelligent if it can successfully mimic human responses in the game. Do you agree with this definition of intelligence? Why or why not?

3. Describe a criticisms, limitation, or objection to Imitation Game as a measure of intelligence.

4. Turing raises the question of whether machines can think. What is one argument he presents regarding this question?

5. Describe one way the Imitation Game may have influenced the development of artificial intelligence and the field of natural language processing?

6. Turing's paper was written in 1950. How do you think advancements in technology and our understanding of AI have changed the way we perceive the Imitation Game today?
